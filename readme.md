# HOMESTATE

This repository contains the source code for a website built using React, Redux, Framer Motion, and React Router. The website allows users to search for properties, bookmark properties for future reference, and bookmark contact information for property owners.

## Features

- Search: Users can search for properties using various search criteria such as location, price range, and property type.

- Property Bookmark: Users can bookmark properties they are interested in and easily access them later.

- Owner Contact Bookmark: Users can bookmark contact information for property owners and reach out to them when needed.

- Static Data: The website utilizes static data since an API for data fetching was unavailable. The data is preloaded within the application.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Redux: State management library for managing application state.

- Framer Motion: Animation library for creating smooth and interactive animations.

- React Router: Library for handling routing and navigation in a React application.
